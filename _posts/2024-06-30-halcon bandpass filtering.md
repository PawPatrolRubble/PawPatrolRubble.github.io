## introduction

Bandpass filtering is a signal processing technique that allows frequencies within a specific range to pass through while attenuating frequencies outside this range. This technique is used to isolate a particular band of frequencies from a broader spectrum, enhancing or extracting specific features of interest in various applications such as audio processing, communication systems, and image processing.

## Key Concepts

### Frequency Domain

Signals can be represented in the frequency domain, where their components are analyzed based on their frequencies.
Low frequencies correspond to slow changes or smooth areas, and high frequencies correspond to rapid changes or edges and noise.
Bandpass Filter:

A bandpass filter has two critical parameters: **the lower cutoff frequency (f_low)** and **the upper cutoff frequency (f_high)**.
It allows frequencies between f_low and f_high to pass through while attenuating frequencies below f_low and above f_high.
Types of Bandpass Filters
Analog Bandpass Filters:

Implemented using electrical components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
Commonly used in radio frequency applications to isolate specific channels.
Digital Bandpass Filters:

Implemented using algorithms and digital signal processing techniques.
Used in various digital applications, including audio processing, image processing, and data analysis.

### skeleton(operator)

compute the skeleteton of a region
skeleton computes the skeleton, i.e., the medial axis of the input regions. The skeleton is constructed in a way that each point on it can be seen as the center point of a circle with the largest radius possible while still being completely contained in the region.
